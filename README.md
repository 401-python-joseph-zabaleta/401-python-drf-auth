# Lab: Class 33 - Authentication & Production Server

## Open Git Pull Requests  


## Overview  

Let’s move our API closer to production grade by adding Authentication and switching to a Production Server

## Feature Tasks and Requirements  

### Django
- [x] Add JWT Authentication to your API.
  - [x] Install needed libraries in project configuration and/or site settings.
- [x] Keep existing authentication so DRF Browsable API still usable.
  - [x] That includes keeping the styling
  - [x] Install needed libraries in project configuration and/or site settings.

### Docker  
- [x] Create a boilerplate Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml so you don’t need to start from scratch each time.
- [x] Switch to using Gunicorn instead of Django’s built in development server.
  - mind the number of workers to avoid sluggishness
- Warning You will run into styling issues when you switch over to Gunicorn.
  - On Django side you’ll need to properly handle static files.
- [x] Adjust docker-compose.yml so that data is persisted in a volume outside of container.

## User Acceptance Tests  
- [x] Use tests from demo and adjust as needed for your project.
- [x] Ensure tests pass

## Dependencies
